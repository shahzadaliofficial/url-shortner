# Frontend Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
The email verification links are returning 404 NOT_FOUND errors because:
1. The frontend Vercel deployment has outdated URLs in `vercel.json`
2. Missing SPA (Single Page Application) routing configuration for React Router

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Updated `frontend/vercel.json`
- ✅ Updated API URL to new backend: `https://usner.vercel.app`
- ✅ Added `rewrites` configuration for SPA routing
- ✅ Removed outdated environment variables

### 2. SPA Routing Configuration
Added proper rewrites to handle React Router routes in production:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Redeploy Frontend to Vercel
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
Ensure these are set in Vercel project settings:
- `VITE_API_URL=https://usner.vercel.app`

### 3. Test Verification Links
After redeployment, test:
- Registration process
- Email verification links
- All frontend routes

## Expected Results After Fix
- ✅ Email verification links will work properly
- ✅ All React Router routes will work in production
- ✅ No more 404 errors for frontend routes
- ✅ Proper SPA behavior on Vercel

## Test URLs
- Frontend: `https://url-shortner-shahzad.vercel.app`
- Backend: `https://usner.vercel.app`
- Test verification: `https://url-shortner-shahzad.vercel.app/verify-email?token=test`
