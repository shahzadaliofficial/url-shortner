## 🔧 CONFIGURATION

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
```
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.ethereal.email
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_test_email@ethereal.email
EMAIL_PASS=your_test_password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@urlshortener.com
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### CORS Configuration
- ✅ Multiple frontend ports supported (5173-5176)
- ✅ Credentials enabled for cookie handling

## 🚀 WORKING FEATURES

### User Registration Flow
1. User fills registration form
2. Backend creates unverified user account
3. Verification email sent (logged in development)
4. User sees "Email Verification Required" screen
5. User can resend verification email if needed

### Email Verification Flow
1. User clicks verification link in email
2. Frontend `/verify-email` page handles token
3. Backend verifies token and activates account
4. User automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

### Login Flow
1. User attempts login with unverified email
2. Backend blocks login with verification error
3. Frontend shows verification required message
4. User can resend verification email

### Protected Routes
1. Dashboard checks user verification status
2. Unverified users see verification required screen
3. Verified users access dashboard normally

## 📋 TESTING RESULTS

✅ **Registration**: Creates unverified user and sends email
✅ **Login Block**: Prevents unverified users from logging in  
✅ **Resend Email**: Successfully sends new verification emails
✅ **Email Verification**: Token-based verification works
✅ **Auto-Login**: Users logged in after verification
✅ **Protected Routes**: Verification status checked

## 🌐 SERVERS RUNNING

- **Backend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 ✅
- **MongoDB**: Connected ✅

## 📧 EMAIL TESTING

Currently using Ethereal test SMTP credentials. In development mode:
- Emails are logged to console instead of being sent
- Test credentials are used for actual SMTP testing
- Ready for production SMTP service integration

## 🎯 PRODUCTION READY

To deploy to production:
1. Update `.env` with real SMTP credentials (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
2. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
3. Update `FRONTEND_URL` to production domain
4. All email verification logic is production-ready
